# Leaflet-Challenge

For this challenge, I am creating an earthquake visualization through data gathered from the United States Geological Survey. This is the link to their website: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. This Challenge uses both HTML and JavaScript to create a website of a map of the earthquake dataset from the USGS.

In order to view the website with the map of the earthquake dataset, you will have to download this github repository. Then you will have to use a local server python -m or use Live Server in VS Code to open the file index.html and view the website.
